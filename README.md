# reticle

Simple app for showing a centered reticle. This project was created for personal use only.

## But Why

I've been playing some [Halo LASO](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/LASO) recently and I was missing my reticle. So I created one.

## Dependencies

- [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)

## Linux Build

Make sure to have raylib installed

```
git clone https://www.github.com/Seng3694/reticle
cd reticle
make release=1
```

## Installation

After building it you can use the following command to copy the binary file to `/usr/local/bin`:

```
make install
``` 

To remove it again use:

```
make uninstall
```

## Usage

After successfully installing it you can run it directly from the command line and exit it with CTRL+C
